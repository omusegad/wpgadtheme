This plugin will use a jQuery plugin called [International Telephone Input](http://jackocnr.com/intl-tel-input.html) to create a new type of input for Contact Form 7 that shows country flags to write a prefix of the telephone number.

= How to use it? =

Once you have installed and activated your plugin, a new type of field will be available in your Contact Form 7 forms. In order to add it to your form, you can either click on the "International Telephone" button above your form editor, or add the shortcode like: [intl_tel* {your-phone}] ({your-phone} has to be replaced by the name you want to give the field and * is optional and makes the field compulsory).

To recover the field's info on your email, use this tag: [{your-phone}]. It will print something like +12025550109

You can also recover specific parts of the telephone number: the name of the country it refers to, the country code, the number without the country code. Use this tags:

1. [{your-phone}-cf7it-country-name]: It prints the name of the country. For the example above: United States
2. [{your-phone}-cf7it-country-code]: It prints the country code of the phone number. For the example above: 1
3. [{your-phone}-cf7it-country-iso2]: It prints the country iso code. For the example above: us
